# MatchVector

Pulls football data from [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/) (v3) into a Supabase Postgres database.

**Leagues:** Premier League, Championship, League One, League Two, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1. Edit them in `matchvector/config.py`.
**Data:** leagues/seasons, teams and venues, fixtures and results, per-team match statistics (including xG), standings, and pre-match odds.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in API_FOOTBALL_KEY and DATABASE_URL
python -m matchvector status    # checks the API key and shows quota
python -m matchvector init-db   # creates the tables in Supabase
```

For `DATABASE_URL`, go to the Supabase dashboard, click **Connect**, and copy the **Session pooler** string. The direct connection only works over IPv6.

## Syncing

```bash
python -m matchvector sync all                      # everything, seasons 2020-2026
python -m matchvector sync fixtures --seasons 2026  # refresh the current season only
python -m matchvector sync stats --limit 5000       # stats backfill, resumable
python -m matchvector sync odds                     # upcoming fixtures' odds
```

Run `leagues` before the other targets, because every other table references it. `sync all` does this for you.

Every sync is an upsert, so you can re-run it safely. Match stats are fetched only for finished fixtures that don't have them yet. Each call covers 20 fixtures via `/fixtures?ids=`, so one season across all 8 leagues costs about 170 calls. Syncing stops cleanly when the daily quota drops to `API_DAILY_RESERVE`. Run it again the next day to carry on.

API-Football only serves **odds** from about 14 days before kickoff, so you can't backfill history. Run `sync odds` daily. Each run keeps the latest price per bookmaker and market (the markets are listed in `ODDS_BET_IDS`).

## Nightly refresh

`python -m matchvector nightly` refreshes everything that changes. It runs these steps in order:
1. Re-checks league metadata, which marks each competition's current season.
2. Refreshes teams, fixtures/results and standings for every current season, plus any season that ended in the last 14 days.
3. Fetches stats for newly finished matches.
4. Pulls odds for upcoming matches.
5. Updates the club rankings (see below).

A normal night uses about 350–500 API calls and takes a few minutes. If one competition fails, the others still run, and the exit code is non-zero.

The GitHub Actions workflow [`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`](.github/workflows/nightly.yml) runs this command every day at 03:00 UTC. You can also start it by hand: open the **Actions** tab, choose **Nightly sync**, then **Run workflow**. It needs two repository secrets, under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- `API_FOOTBALL_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`: use the Supabase **Session pooler** string.

## Club ranking

This is a port of the Club Ranking Google Sheet. Every finished fixture is replayed oldest first, ordered by kickoff time, with the fixture ID breaking ties. For each fixture:

- Expected goal difference = (home rank × 1.09 − away rank) / 100
- Rank change = (actual goal difference − expected goal difference) × 10, or × 5 in domestic cups (FA Cup, EFL Cup, EFL Trophy, FA Trophy, Community Shield, Scottish cups). This isn't in the sheet: at × 10, rotated squads and giant-killings drained points from the top leagues. European competitions and the Club World Cup keep × 10.
- The home team gains the rank change and the away team loses it.

A team's first rank is `leagues.starting_rank` of the first league it plays in. For a team that only ever appears in cups, it's the `starting_rank` of the first cup it plays in.

- `team_rank_history` holds each team's rank before and after every match, like the Ranking Breakdown tab.
- `team_rankings` holds the current summary, like the Ranking tab: current rank, 30 and 100 Ranking, ST ALGO, LT ALGO, and HG/HA/AG/AA over the last 12 months.
- `team_rankings` also has a `reliability` score from 0 to 100, which isn't in the sheet:
  - It's mainly driven by games played: a team scores 66% after 38 games, 89% after 76 and 96% after 114.
  - It's reduced only when a team's rank fluctuates massively. `rank_volatility` is the standard deviation of the rank around its own trend line over the last 30 games, so a steady rise or fall doesn't count, and neither do big per-match changes that cancel out, as happens with dominant teams. At 27 or below (about three-quarters of teams) there's no reduction, at 40 the score is ×0.55 and at 60 it's ×0.30.
  - The constants are at the top of `matchvector/ranking.py`.

```bash
python -m matchvector rank   # the nightly job runs this after syncing
```

Every run replays all fixtures from scratch, which takes seconds. Late results, corrected scores and changes to `starting_rank` are all picked up automatically.
